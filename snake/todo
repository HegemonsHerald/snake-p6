NOTE: I've disabled the autocmd that changes the vim guicursor to a pipe-line. That was the cause of 'q's showing up in tmux....
NOTE: My game pause isn't actually a game pause, cause the timers keep ticking, they just stop doing things. I think it's just about fine enough for me...


NEXT UP:

	- bug: if the snake collides with its tail end, it collides with a segment, that'll be moved away. The game-over doesn't work there

	- bug: snake just randomly quit, claiming a segment doesn't have a y-field...? one time error?

	- snake head with ▲ ▶ ▼ ◀

	- make snake start direction depend on the settings

	- make methods, that can be private, private
