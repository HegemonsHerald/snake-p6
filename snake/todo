NEXT UP:

	- fix game-over to power down ncurses
	   - something with the restarting is going wrong now, and I don't know what
	   - possible solution: move game logic into its own scope, so the global vars are deallocated on game over (a real proper reset), except for the SETTINGS var and the SIZE vars and shit...

	- add game-over screen

	- make methods, that can be private, private

	- add retry-code: update High-Score and render High-Score

	- add pause screen
		- requires the motion intervals to be stopped
			→ they have a current speed, eh? rename init-timers to start-timers
			→ have the Timer.pause method add an interval, that just does nothing
			→ have the Timer.resume method add an interval, that again does the normal things
		- requires the Timers to be stored in a field upon Snake instantiation
			→ make it so the $.timer field can remain uninitialized til after the Snake creation

	- snake head with ▲ ▶ ▼ ◀

	- make snake start-direction variable (requires code to create snake in right direction)
