NOTE: I've disabled the autocmd that changes the vim guicursor to a pipe-line. That was the cause of 'q's showing up in tmux....


NEXT UP:

	- bug: if the snake collides with its tail end, it collides with a segment, that'll be moved away. The game-over doesn't work there

	- bug: snake just randomly quit, claiming a segment doesn't have a y-field...? one time error?

	- make methods, that can be private, private

	- add retry-code: update High-Score and render High-Score

	- add pause screen
		- requires the motion intervals to be stopped
			→ they have a current speed, eh? rename init-timers to start-timers
			→ have the Timer.pause method add an interval, that just does nothing
			→ have the Timer.resume method add an interval, that again does the normal things
		- requires the Timers to be stored in a field upon Snake instantiation
			→ make it so the $.timer field can remain uninitialized til after the Snake creation

	- snake head with ▲ ▶ ▼ ◀

	- make snake start-direction variable (requires code to create snake in right direction)
