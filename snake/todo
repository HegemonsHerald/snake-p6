		- there still is an unidentified problem with the init-timers and timer functions
		- welcome-screen's getch doesn't seem to react to l and h...

	- add game-over screen

	- make methods, that can be private, private

	- add retry-code: update High-Score and render High-Score

	- add pause screen
		- requires the motion intervals to be stopped
			→ they have a current speed, eh? rename init-timers to start-timers
			→ have the Timer.pause method add an interval, that just does nothing
			→ have the Timer.resume method add an interval, that again does the normal things
		- requires the Timers to be stored in a field upon Snake instantiation
			→ make it so the $.timer field can remain uninitialized til after the Snake creation
