NEXT UP:

	1. backwards motion is handled as a self-collision, but it needs to be ignored instead!
		- go through the safe-guard code
		- make it work

	2. it still passes through 0,0 → that's definitely to do with the scaling

		- here's what's happening: if you move to a location that's negatively outside a window, ncurses won't render anything.
					   if you move to a location that's positively outside a window, ncurses puts the character/string in the 0,0 position (for some reason)		⇒ LOOK UP THIS BEHAVIOUR: WHY?

		- so that means the x-direction scaling needs to be properly done, so the floored division always produces good results!

	3. the welcome-message for toooo small for a proper message, leave empty doesn't work
		- at the size 8by8 it doesn't even start, same for 12by12
		→ that's because of the welcome-message thing

	CONSIDER MAKING THE SIZE ADJUST TO ALWAYS STRAIGHT NUMBERS...


	4. the speed change doesn't work at all
		- refactor it so that all the data structures are held by the Snake Class (you may put the var declarations to the method call un-hoistedly this time)
		- see if it's to do with that...
		- rewrite the interval changer to work differently, eg async delta time check	→ revert to initial fix-timers commit
		- if all else fails, make a game-wide interval					→ revert to initial fix-timers commit
		- if even that fails, use a contant interval	→ return to main branch and delete, what's in the timer sub
